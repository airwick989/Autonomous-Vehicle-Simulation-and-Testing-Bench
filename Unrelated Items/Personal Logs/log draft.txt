Transferred working windows version to ubuntu, solved COM port communication error, it is running and is showing speed/collisions, but is not rendering properly on pygame window (it freezes after running for a bit, may be performance limitation with virtual machine), manual_control.py ran fine on ubuntu so it most likely is not a performance issue, decided to use manual_control.py as a base and connect peripherals one by one, transferred wheel and pedal functionality from client_MODIFIED.py into manual_control.py to create testbed.py, resolved more port communications, improvements made from windows version: (drastically improved performance, drastically improved ui responsiveness, faster render, much more immediate response to peripheral inputs, now has a fully detailed HUD with useful information), suppressedsome runtime errors experienced during manual testing, added offset to mitigate steering angle issue, items left to connect: (shifter, guage cluster, adb?)
