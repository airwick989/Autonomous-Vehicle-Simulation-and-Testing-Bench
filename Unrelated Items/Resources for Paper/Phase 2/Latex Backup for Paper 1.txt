There currently exists a need for a platform that provides users with the ability to perform extensive, repeatable and meaningful simulation and testing for an autonomous vehicle system whilst being broadly accessible, widely supported and provides robust features and development tools. The contemporary implementations of similar systems are either financially exorbitant or highly regulated and contained. The system reflected in this paper aims to fill a gap in the industry of autonomous vehicles and infrastructure by providing a highly robust and streamlined platform to support the development of autonomous vehicle driving systems using widely supported and easily accessible open-source software. This paper will outline the design and development of a proposed system to fulfill this need. The software tools and hardware components chosen for the system will be discussed, followed by the features constructed throughout the development process. The end result of the system is a platform that allows for quick, repeatable, accurate, and nearly endless testing of a digital twin of real life vehicles. This system will allow users to gain valuable simulation and testing data of hardware and software components in a manner which is not always feasible using the traditional methods of autonomous vehicle testing.

\section{Introduction}
With the rapid growth experienced by the autonomous vehicle industry, the need for development support is a point of focus which is becoming much more paramount. "The global autonomous vehicle market was estimated USD 94.43 billion in 2021 and is is projected to hit around USD 1808.44 billion by 2030" [1]. While there is clear evidence of the dominating presence of autonomous vehicle technology, the availability of tools and platforms to provide backing for the development of autonomous vehicle systems is much less strong. Currently, the most used software platforms to support the development of autonomous vehicle driving systems, such as RTI, Adasis and Waymo for example, are highly contained and available only to large industrial vehicle manufacturers who posses the resources and funds to partner with such companies [2]-[5]. There exists no readily available simulation and development platform in this industry and large vehicle manufacturers all have personal access to such facilities, making access to such tools highly contained. Exorbitant costs of development tools also pose as a barricade as "current estimates for the cost of a self-driving hardware and software package range from \$70,000 to \$150,000" (USD) [6]. 

In addition to the lack availability, there exists a need in the autonomous vehicle development space for a widely supported platform which provides the ability to perform repeatable, testable and highly extendable development and simulation activities. As of 2020, at least \$16 Billion USD has been expended towards autonomous vehicle system testing across only 30 companies [7]. One of the largest companies involved, Waymo, spent \$3.5 Billion USD alone performing testing activities [8]. The frequency of testing which may be performed is also constrained by currently adopted methods. One could run tests on an autonomous vehicle system using a live vehicle, but that would allow thorough testing to feasibly occur every few days. 

From the evidence presented, it is apparent that there is a need in the autonomous vehicle development space for a platform the fulfills the mentioned needs and criteria. The contemporary implementations of similar systems are either financially exorbitant or highly regulated and contained. In order to fill this gap in the industry, research and development was conducted to develop a system which will target the critical areas of interest as highlighted previously. 

The goal of the proposed system is to provide a hardware bench that can streamline the development process by providing robust testing and development tools, a highly extendable and modifiable platform, an intuitive and interactive environment, all whilst containing repeatable consistent data logging features. In addition, one of the primary goals of the proposed system is to be easily accessible and widely supported, as such, the choices of both the software and hardware are critical. 

Currently, no such open-source test bed exists. The construction of such a system will enable the simulation and testing of new algorithms in different, real-world driving situations within a hardware-in-the-loop environment. Hardware-in-the-loop or HIL systems are apparatuses which manipulate real signals from a controller "into thinking it is in the assembled product", whereas in reality, the controller is "connected to a test system that simulates reality" [9]. This configuration allows for design iterations to be influenced by results obtained from tests and simulations which emulate the real-world system in real-world situations [9]. This enables users to "easily run through thousands of possible scenarios to properly exercise their controller without the cost and time associated with actual physical tests" [9].

This paper will outline the design and construction of a platform that was established to support the development and simulation of autonomous vehicle driving systems and algorithms. Section 2 of this paper will present the contributions of the simulation bench and what the system will offer. Section 3 will overview the initial objectives set out for the system and the requirements it must fulfill. Section 3 will highlight what tools and technologies were chosen for the construction of the system and provide reasoning for those decisions. Section 4 will examine the architecture of the system which was constructed from the materials in section 3. Section 5 will outline what enhancements and features have been added to the system throughout its development lifespan thus far. Section 6 will briefly discuss the future developments that have been planned to be integrated into the system. Section 7 will provide concluding remarks on the topics which have been covered throughout this paper.


\section{System Contributions}
This section will overview the primary benefits which the simulation bench will offer as a result of its development and construction.

\subsection{A Widely Accessible and Inexpensive Testing Solution}
One of the most constraining factors of current methods of autonomous vehicle testing and development is that the tools used for these activities are privately owned or proprietary. Most car manufacturers have their own systems in place and are inaccessible to the majority of the population. This makes the autonomous vehicle development space highly regulated and contained. In addition, the tools and resources required for autonomous vehicle development and testing is exorbitant, as outlined in the introduction section of this paper.

By being based entirely on open-source software which is backed by large communities and support, the simulation bench brings forth a much more widely accessible platform to perform development and simulation activities for autonomous vehicle systems. Furthermore, this form of platform is completely unregulated and requires no corporate involvement of any kind, allowing for this system to be much more approachable by a larger user base. 

Another benefit is the low cost associated with the construction of the simulation bench. Most of the costs associated with the construction of the simulation bench are not critical to the aspects that enable the development features of the system, allowing the cost to be reduced significantly if required.

\subsection{A Method which is not Time-bound and is Repeatable}
Using the traditional means of autonomous vehicle testing, testing cannot simply be done all day round at any time of the day. The tests would require personnel and preparation, as well as other environmental factors to work with the required test criteria.
Furthermore, With real world tests of autonomous vehicles, testing cannot be done in a repeated fashion. There is lots of downtime in between tests and actions are hard to replicate.

The simulation bench provides means of being able to perform thorough, accurate to life testing in a repeatable manner. Furthermore, as the testing would occur in simulation environment, all aspects of the environment and vehicle can be easily recorded and re-enacted for repeated testing.

Another benefit of the simulation-based approach is that testing activities are not bound by time. There is no need to wait for personnel and preparation, as well as other environmental factors to work with the required test criteria. Everything can be set in the simulation as required and testing can occur at any time throughout the day.

\subsection{A Contained Environment for Testing Before Deployment}
Another negative aspect with the current methods of testing autonomous vehicle systems is the inherent danger associated with it. If any anomalies are exhibited in the driving software in real-world environments, the results may be catastrophic. With this form of testing, there will always be constraints and barriers that may not allow for corner cases to be thoroughly tested.

The simulation bench provides a platform for testing to occur in a contained simulation environment, where a variety of scenarios can be safely explored while mitigating the risk of deploying the software prematurely on a real-world vehicle. The simulation bench can act as a first phase of testing before eventually being deployed on a real vehicle for testing.

\subsection{A System that Inhibits Extendability and Modifiability}
 The open-source nature of the system allows users to easily tailor and extend the simulation bench’s capabilities as they desire. The simulation bench is in no way constrained by the traditional limitations of autonomous vehicle development and allows for a large user base to easily engage and perform research, testing and development on numerous aspects of autonomous vehicle systems. 
 
 The modifiable nature of the simulation bench also saves on costs significantly. Using current methodologies, once most of the hardware and software of an autonomous vehicle system is established and finalized, if a change needs to occur, a lot of time and cost will be wasted in order to make those changes. This can be avoided with the use of the simulation bench.

\subsection{An HIL-based Testing System}
The simulation bench is a hardware-in-the-loop based system and adopts a plug-and-play personality, allowing users to simulate and test different hardware and software components before deployment on real vehicles. 

Users will be able to co-simulate digital twins of real-world systems in order to gain valuable simulation and testing data. The simulation bench can be used to verify both hardware and software components of an autonomous vehicle system before beginning testing on a real-world environment. 


\section{Preliminary System Objectives}
This section will outline more specifically what features the system aims to have and what objectives it projects to meet. Shown below is a list containing the specific action items to be achieved as a result of the development of the system.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A software platform that: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Contains a wide selection of tools and resources to perform advanced simulation activities of autonomous vehicle systems and their environments.
        \item Has real-time traffic control and traffic flow simulation.
        \item Provides interfaces to access key data and parameters from the simulations.
        \item Contains built-in sensors which simulate the behaviour of their real-world counterparts.
        \item Supports multiple maps and locations.
        \item Contains varying time-of-day and weather controls.
    \end{itemize}
\item Hardware peripherals which provide a more cohesive experience to the user by providing the following:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Steering Wheel
        \item Pedals
        \item Gear Shifter
        \item Gauge Cluster
    \end{itemize}
\item A head unit containing a widely used operating system to communicate useful data to and from the simulator and also support application development.
\item Integrate a CAN (Control Area Network) bus into the system.
\item Data recording functionalities which automatically outputs and visualizes large data sets.
\item Design an automated testing framework to support continuous integration and development for the system.
\end{enumerate}

The end result of obtaining these objectives is an autonomous vehicle system simulation and development platform in the form of a hardware bench. This bench should provide the ability to easily record simulation telemetry of both manual driving and autonomous driving while providing meaningful data to support the development of autonomous driving algorithms. This bench should also allow for testing activities to take place regarding various aspects of an autonomous vehicle system in order to streamline the development process. The entire system should also be designed in such a manner that the software components are easily modifiable to meet development needs.


\section{Tools, Technologies and Materials Chosen}
This will highlight what choices have been made in regards to the selection of tools and technologies for the key areas of the simulation bench.

\subsection{Selection of the Base Software Platform}
The software platform that was chosen to be the base of the simulation bench was CARLA. CARLA (Car Learning to Act) has been "developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites, environmental conditions, full control of all static and dynamic actors, maps generation and much more" [10].

As CARLA is an open-source software platform, it is much more accessible than other, more proprietary methods. Being open-source allows anyone to be able to access the software and begin development with very little setup. This aspect also promotes continuous support as a larger user base has access to the platform and may suggest improvements or help to implement those improvements as well. 
    
CARLA has been written in Python and has been designed to be highly modifiable and extendable [10]. This is to easily allow the addition of new features and to support the development of autonomous vehicle driving algorithms in the CARLA platform. CARLA has shown to be a very promising base for the simulation bench. 

\subsection{Hardware Peripherals to be Connected to the Software}
The CARLA software mentioned previously comes preconfigured with keyboard controls when driving vehicles in manual mode, meaning autonomous control is inactive [10]. These keyboard controls are perfectly suitable for testing purposes focusing on autonomous driving and is not necessary if that is the primary focus, however, the simulation bench should be able to simulate both manual and autonomous driving nearly simultaneously by allowing users to switch between the modes in real-time. This would allow for better testing and development opportunities. 

In order to provide that cohesive experience to better simulate real-world driving, various hardware peripherals were paired with the software to provide a more familiar method for users to interface with the simulation bench. 

Furthermore, this provides an opportunity to perform testing and simulation of the hardware peripherals in the simulation bench's hardware-in-the-loop configuration.

Found below are the initial setup materials for the HIL system [11]-[12]:

            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \caption{[11]-[12]}
\end{table}

For the head unit that will communicate with the simulator, an Android-based infotainment was chosen. This is because the Android operating system is widely supported in the application of external device and software connectivity while also having the most users [13]. The Android operating system holds over 43\% of the OS market share worldwide, with "over 2.5 billion active users spanning over 190 countries" [14], [13]. Due to this large support, there exists tools and packages that provide communication interfaces with the operating system, making an Android-based head unit a perfect candidate. 

Found below is a Bill of Materials for the hardware components used for implementing the head unit to the simulation bench [12]:
\begin{table}[!ht]

            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \caption{[12]}
\end{table}

\subsection{Facilitating Communication with the Android Head Unit}
Communication between the Android-based head unit and the simulation software will be enabled using the Android-developed Android Debug Bridge (ADB). 

The ADB is a powerful command-line tool which facilitates communication and data transfer to and from an Android device [15]. It essentially acts as in interface for transmitting and receiving messages/data to and from a device running the Android operating system [15]. The ADB allows for the control of various device functions, installing and debugging applications, running commands on the device externally, retrieving data from the device, etc [15].  

The simulation software will use the pure-python-adb Python package in order to create a communication bridge between the Python-based simulator and the ADB interface [16]. This library will allow the simulation software to use the ADB interface's functionalities using purely Python code [16]. 

\subsection{CAN Technologies to be Integrated into the System}
To support CAN development and testing on the simulation bench, the cantools (CAN Bus Tools) Python package and the CANdevStudio software for Linux will be used. 

The cantools package provides tools that provide the ability to perform CAN data encoding and decoding, CAN bus generation and monitoring, network node testing and many others [17]. This package provides powerful functions which will allow the simulation bench to establish CAN buses, enabling vehicle subsystem communication and interpretation of CAN data to and from vehicle networks [17]. 

The CANdevStudio software is a CAN simulation software which aims to provide cost-effective means of simulating CAN messages and providing an easy-to-use interface for sending CAN signals [18]. CANdevStudio has been specifically designed keeping automotive development in mind and functions with various forms of hardware interfaces as well as virtual [18].

\subsection{Tools Chosen to Construct the Testing Framework}
The continuous testing and development framework is planned to primarily be developed using the Python Unittest library and the Jenkins platform. 

The Python Unittest library provides a unit testing framework for Python 3 environments [19]. It provides a wide array of functions to support "test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework" [19]. Python Unittest will allow for effortless construction of complex and thorough test suites that will be run on the simulation bench while also running setup and tear down of the test cases automatically [19].

The Jenkins platform is the leading open-source automation server and "provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project" [20]. This allows for Jenkins to be fashioned as a continuous integration an testing server, allowing for the automation of unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing as changes in the code are committed [20]. Jenkins can be used to automate the testing framework on the simulation bench, such that as updates are pushed to the simulation bench's repository, a slew of testing activities automatically take place to ensure the integrity of both the system and the changes being made to it [20].


\section{High-Level System Architecture Overview}
This section will outline the the general architecture and control flow of the major hardware and software aspects of the simulation bench. The hardware architecture making up the simulation bench can be found below [11]:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{Hardware Layout.drawio.png}
  \caption{System Hardware Communication [11]}
\end{figure}
\pagebreak
\subsection{Server Multi-client Architecture}
An important point contention is that the CARLA architecture is structured in a client-server fashion [10]. The world in which the simulation takes place in will contain the map, all environmental assets, and will be responsible for rendering those elements [10]. In addition, all traffic rendering and simulation will also take place on the server-side [10]. This allows for high scalability as a server machine may serve multiple client machines, creating a server multi-client architecture [10]. Adopting this architecture allows multiple clients in the same or different nodes to control different actors (vehicles) in the same world [10]. Alternatively, the client and server may also exist on the same machine [10].

\subsection{Control Peripherals}
A user of the simulation bench will interact with only the client machine, where simulation of the testing vehicle takes place. The user will primarily interface through the steering wheel/pedals/shifter kit, but may also use the keyboard for additional functions such as switching which sensors are monitored, changing environment variables, performing ADB functions, etc. All these inputs will be sent to and interpreted by the simulation software on the client machine.

Using CARLA's extensive API, the original input mapping was rebound to correctly comprehend the input received from the newly connected hardware peripherals. As some input from the hardware peripherals are analog, notably the pedals, some processing was done using logarithmic functions to correctly translate the input data when being sent to the simulation software. 

\subsection{Arduino Microcontroller and Gauge Cluster}
As the gauge cluster strictly uses analog signals which are read using serial pins, there exists no easily accessible interface to communicate digital data from the simulation software to the cluster. As a result, an Arduino microcontroller is required to act as a middleware of communication between the simulation software and the gauge cluster hardware. Shown below is a realistic schematic of the physical connections required to enable signal communication between the microcontroller and the gauge cluster [21]:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.43\textwidth]{arduino_to_cluster.jpg}
  \caption{Microcontroller to Cluster Connection Schematic [21]}
\end{figure}

The microcontroller is used to read the digital data exported from the simulation and correctly map it to an analog signal. This remapping procedure was refined extensively to scale to correct physical readings on the gauge cluster. This data processing and conversion is done within an Arduino script that is uploaded into the microcontroller itself.

The data sent from the simulation software consisted of the vehicle speed (Kilometers per Hour) and the crankshaft's angular velocity within the vehicle's engine (Revolutions per Minute).

\subsection{The ADB and Head Unit}
The Android-based head unit is connected to the client machine via USB. With the ADB interface built into the head unit's operating system, the pure-python-adb package on the client machine will be used to establish a communication channel and send commands and data through it. For this communication to be possible, USB debugging needs to be enabled on the Android-based head unit. Found below is a figure outlining the high-level architecture of the client-to-ADB connection [16]:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{adb connection.png}
  \caption{ADB Connection Architecture [16]}
\end{figure}

The pure-python-adb package can be used to connect to the Android device by establishing a locally hosted server communicating at TCP port 5037 by default [16]. Using that port as the channel of communication, the ADB server will begin running the ADB daemon on the Android device such that all ADB operations will be handled as a background process [16].\\ 

This concludes the overview of the simulation bench's layout and architecture. The remaining elements that have been implemented into the system are strictly software based and will be covered in following sections.

\section{Enhancements and Features Integrated into the System}
This section will highlight the features and improvements introduced to the simulation bench as incremental developments. The connection and mapping of manual vehicle controls to the hardware peripherals will be omitted from this section as this topic was already previously covered. 

\subsection{ADB Functions and Development Potential}
Upon installing the necessary ADB tools on the simulation bench and establishing the required communications, several features were implemented to the system to take advantage of the Android-based head unit. 

\subsubsection{Added ADB Functions}\leavevmode \\
Firstly, a curated library was developed, containing preconfigured methods for controlling various functions on the head unit. This library will allow for future development to more readily take place as many functionalities regarding the control of the head unit has already been developed and may be reused as required. Functionalities include controlling the operating system navigation on the head unit, various user interface controls, and most importantly, application launching and debugging functions. 

Numerous library functions were integrated into the simulation software and mapped to button controls on the steering wheel. Found below is an overview of the button mappings and their corresponding functionalities:
\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
        \begin{tabular}{ |c|c| } 
            \hline

            Recent Applications & Upper-right Diagonal Button from Home \\ 
            Launch Google Maps & Left Paddle \\ 
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \caption{Sample ADB Functions}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Future Development and Testing Opportunities}\leavevmode \\
The functions above represent the most rudimentary operations which can be undertaken as a result of the ADB implementation. The primary advantage are the testing and debugging capabilities that come with this communication interface. 

Take for example, a user of this simulation bench has developed a driving agent which has advanced far enough that they would like to begin testing the agent's navigational capabilities. As mentioned before, the CARLA platform supports importing custom maps from external software [10]. A replication of real-world driving environments may be imported into the simulation bench and be used for the testing and development of autonomous driving systems. 

The user can take advantage of the simulation bench's capabilities and perform navigation testing on their driving agent within real-world road conditions. The user may develop some functionality into their autonomous driving algorithms to fetch data from the Google Maps application in the Android head unit in order to guide their agent to a waypoint. There exists an API to retrieve Google Maps data which comes included in the Android Software Development Kit [22]. While the user's agent will be responsible for controlling the vehicle and all that it entails, the navigation data guiding the agent can be retrieved from the ADB interface on the head unit. This can save extensive amounts of both money and time by performing a large amount of real-world testing from within a simulation environment and without being constrained by the limitations which come with real-world testing of such systems.

The communication is also possible in the reverse order, where the head unit may retrieve information from the simulation software. Take for example, a user wishes to perform development on user interface features for their driving system, one of which is for lane-invasion warning to appear on the head unit. As the simulation software has built in lane-invasion sensors whose messages can easily be accessed using the CARLA API, this sort of development is possible with the ADB [10].

\subsection{Integration of a CAN Bus}
Modern day vehicles contain multitudes of computers and subsystems which all must communicate successfully. As of 2016, the " average car has 30 to 50 different computers, and high-end cars have as many as 100" [23]. Furthermore, modern day vehicles on average are "accompanied by 60 to 100 different electronic sensors", all of which must function in unison whilst transferring data in real time [23]. This is even more prevalent currently, particularly in the autonomous vehicle space, where an even larger number of sensors and computers which are communicating are present. 

Communication amongst these vehicle subsystems are critical, as a majority of them function in a complementary manner [24]. The traditional means of enabling this communications is through hard-wired means such as circuitry and digital systems [24]. However, the disadvantages of this approach are that it presents challenges when designing the architecture of the vehicle's subsystems and this approach also presents higher costs for both the design and implementation [24]. 
The CAN (Control Area Network) standard was introduced to resolve the drawbacks of the traditional approach by allowing the communication features implemented using software alone [24]. The introduction of the CAN bus saves both time and money on creating complex, hard-wired systems to handle communication between vehicle subsystems [24]. In addition, a CAN bus allows various microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other's applications directly without the need of a host machine [24]. 

\subsubsection{CAN Bus Architecture in the Client Machine}\leavevmode \\
Using the cantools package, a CAN bus was integrated into the simulation bench to enable data transfer among vehicle subsystems. Found below is a figure depicting the high-level architecture of the CAN bus implementation within the client machine:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{CAN Architecture.drawio.png}
  \caption{CAN Bus Implementation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{CAN Bus Interface}\leavevmode \\
The cantools package, along with establishing a CAN bus and facilitating the transfer of CAN data, also provides an interface for users to view the data being transmitted on the bus in multiple formats [17]. This CAN data can be decoded using DBC files in order to make reading them more user-friendly [17]. Data being transmitted on the CAN bus can be dumped onto the cantools CAN bus interface and the interface may be used to send data on the bus as well [17]. 

The CAN nodes within the CARLA platform represent devices or sensors within the CARLA simulation software that are transmitting and receiving data on the CAN bus. Those devices have no connection to a CAN by default, this feature was integrated into the software. Found below is a sample screenshot of the CAN bus interface when it is receiving data:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{CAN interface.png}
  \caption{cantools CAN Bus Sample Interface}
\end{figure}

Above is a sample decoded capture of the data being transmitted by the simulation software when the vehicle is in motion. The data being shown in the sample consist of individual wheel speeds, the current gear the vehicle's transmission is in, and the steering angle. As shown in the capture, the raw data is shown as hex values and then decoded using a preconfigured DBC file. Much more data can be transmitted across the CAN bus, however these 3 data items were chosen for demonstration purposes.

\subsubsection{Future Development Opportunities on Smart Infrastructure}\leavevmode \\
The primary reason for the implementation of the CAN bus within the simulation bench was to support future development on autonomous vehicle communication with smart infrastructure. This is when an autonomous vehicle system works in tandem with a smart systems embedded in an environment's infrastructure to improve the autonomous vehicle's driving capabilities and also to improve traffic flow and traffic safety [25]. This is done by having the vehicle's sensors and devices communicate with the smart infrastructure [25]. This uncovers a plethora of possibilities such as having autonomous vehicles know ahead of time what traffic signals will be, adjusting autonomous driving characteristics based off data received from the smart infrastructure, and much more [25]. 

The notion of smart infrastructure communicating with autonomous vehicles is emerging as key solution for safer roads [25]. The CARLA platform has built-in traffic managers which can be used to retrieve traffic and infrastructure data (such as traffic light information) from the CARLA API [10]. These capabilities in conjunction with the integration of a CAN within the simulation bench allows for the future development and simulation of these systems possible on this bench [25].    

\subsubsection{CAN Security Testing}\leavevmode \\
Another aspect of CANs which can be simulated in this system are CAN attacks. One of the contingency point regarding the use of CANs are its security capabilities [26]. While the CAN protocol uses "a CRC for verification of integrity against the transmission errors", "it cannot prevent data injected by malicious parties, which breaks the integrity" [26]. 

As it is known, the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) method of error detection is primarily used for assuring the integrity of network messages by detecting errors on the communication channel [27]. However, CRC is not capable of detecting all forms of error types that may be inhibited by the messages, and furthermore, CRC is "not suitable for protecting against intentional alteration of data" [27]. This results in the reality that the CAN "protocol does not have a comprehensive integrity check and fails to sustain integrity" [26]. 

As these network integrity concerns are present in the current implementation of CANs, which are critical aspects of any vehicle system (particularly in autonomous vehicles), the simulation of CAN attacks was deemed to be an important feature as a part of the simulation bench's development. Having these capabilities integrated into the bench will help support future development on CAN buses and will also provide an accessible and robust platform for performing simulation and testing activities regarding CANs. 

The CANdevStudio software application is used in the system for the simulation and injection of CAN attacks into the vehicle simulation software. The CANdevStudio application can be used to communicate to a CAN bus given the user is aware of the ports and network details of the simulated vehicle's CAN bus. Through that communication software, CANdevStudio can be used to send raw data through the bus which will be interpreted by the simulated vehicle's CAN interface and perform appropriate functions according to the data being sent. The data may range from being interpreted as a data transmission from another vehicle subsystem to an autonomous agent command which may be used to perform malicious actions.

Found below are sample screenshots taken from the CANdevStudio application of a sample CAN attack which will be injected into the simulation software:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{CANdevStudio2.png}
  \caption{Raw Data of 3 Attack Messages in CandevStudio}
\end{figure}

Shown in Figure 6 is the construction of a sample CAN attack in CANdevStudio. The construction if the attack consists of 3 nodes, only 2 of which are necessary for the attack to take place. The CanRawSender node consists of the raw data which will be injected into the CAN bus and is shown in Figure 7. 

The attack messages will be sent, each having a specific id for tracing purposes. The raw data will be interpreted within the vehicle simulation software, each message corresponding to a distinct malicious action. The raw data presented in Figure 7 will perform the following actions on the simulator side: turn the steering wheel fully clockwise, turn the steering wheel fully anti-clockwise and fully apply the throttle. These attack messages will be transmitted in a looping fashion with an interval specified by the user. 

The CanDevice node contains all of the network details of the simulation software's CAN bus in order to communicate with it. The CanRawView node can be used if the user wishes to view the interface of the CAN bus as the messages are transmitted to it.

Shown below are screenshots of the simulation software running normally and the aftermath of the CAN attacks being injected:
\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{figure}[t]

      \includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{CANattack.png}
  \caption{Capture of Simulation Software After CAN Attacks are Injected}
\end{figure}

As visible in Figure 8, the vehicle in the simulation software is driving normally. In figure 9, after the CAN attacks have been transmitted through the CAN bus, the vehicle applies full throttle and begins steering sporadically, causing the vehicle to crash. This is because the data being injected into the CAN bus is being interpreted as autonomous agent inputs and is granting control to the vehicle's subsystems. This is possible as no security measures have been put in place for this vehicle's CAN bus. This is a simple demonstration of the sorts of simulation activities which can take place on this system and highlights how development on CANs can be done using this simulation bench as a platform.

\subsection{Real-time Data Recording and Logging Pipeline}
Arguably the most critical aspect of a simulation platform is the ability to collect and log data resulting from the simulation activities. As such, the most important feature implemented into the simulation bench is the data recording and logging pipeline.

This pipeline was constructed to dramatically streamline testing and development on the simulation bench. A framework was generated from the ground up to easily be able to begin recording simulation data and log it into organized data sets automatically. 

In addition to recording and logging the collected data, the framework also provides tools to automatically visualize the collected data in the form of interactive HTML files. This allows the user of the simulation bench to easily examine and interpret the data that was recorded during the simulation, resulting in meaningful data collection. In addition to this preconfigured arrangement of the data logging pipeline, this pipeline can easily be extended to include more data if the user wishes to do so. Currently, most of the major sensors and critical aspects of the vehicle telemetry are recorded, but the framework is not limited to this data alone. 

For a thorough and detailed overview of the data logging pipeline that has been integrated into the simulation bench, please refer to the research paper titled "INSERT TITLE" by R. Hossain [28].


\section{Future Developments for the System}
This section will overview the next steps in place for the simulation bench and will highlight the remaining features left to be implemented before the entirety of the system objectives have been achieved. It must be noted that this paper acts as a progress report for the work done on the simulation bench thus far.

\subsection{Custom Map Generation}
There currently exists third-party software which can be used to generate and export custom maps to the CARLA platform, and by extension, the simulation bench. An example of a software is RoadRunner. RoadRunner is a MATLAB software that provides an interactive editor for designing fully detailed environments for "simulating and testing automated driving systems" [29]. 

RoadRunner provides an extensive array of tools which help to develop a highly advanced simulation setting, supporting "the visualization of lidar point cloud, aerial imagery, and GIS data" [29]. RoadRunner allows users to easily create roadways by providing the ability to generate functional road networks, traffic lights and intersections, signs, guardrails, road markings, etc [29].

One of the more appealing features of RoadRunner is the ability to import and export road networks using OpenDRIVE [29]. This can allow for the replication of real-world road networks and environments to be used in simulations. One of the future goals of the simulation bench is to reproduce a selection of local Canadian roads using the RoadRunner software and export these environments into the system. This addition to the simulation bench will allow for users to perform all forms of simulation and testing activities in real-world, local roads which can heavily streamline and alleviate the development process of autonomous vehicle systems.

\subsection{Automated Testing Framework}
One of the major key areas of development that is planned to be integrated into the simulation bench is and automated continuous integration and testing framework. This will allow the system to adhere to more streamlined development practices, such that as changes are made to the software or any new features are being pushed to the user's autonomous vehicle system, the framework will automatically run a personalized suite of tests (including the preexisting tests). This can help avoid system regression, improve component integration and make development activities on the simulation bench more efficient.

The automated testing framework is planned to be powered by the Jenkins automation server. As mentioned before in section 3.5, Jenkins may be used as a continuous integration an testing server, allowing for the automation of unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing as changes in the code are committed [20]. 


\section{Conclusion}
The system that has been proposed in this paper addresses numerous key issues mentioned with the currently existing methods used for the development of autonomous vehicle systems.

The autonomous vehicle simulation bench, whose design and development has been thoroughly outline in this paper, fills a need in the autonomous vehicle development industry by specifically targeting the key areas mentioned above. 

Being based-entirely on open-source software which is backed by large communities and nearly endless support, the simulation bench brings forth a much more widely accessible platform to perform development and simulation activities for autonomous vehicle systems. Furthermore, this form of platform is completely unregulated and requires no corporate involvement of any kind, allowing for this system to be much more approachable by a larger user base.

Another benefit relative to currently adopted methods of autonomous vehicle development is the low cost associated with the construction of the simulation bench. Most of the costs associated with the construction of the simulation bench are not critical to the aspects that enable the development features of the system, allowing the cost to be reduced significantly if required.

As the system is based entirely on a simulation approach, testing activities can occur much more frequently and easily. The resources and time required to establish controlled testing for a real-world autonomous vehicle is highly unattainable unless the development is being undertaken by a large manufacturer. Furthermore, the frequency of testing would be significantly lower. The simulation bench provides mean of being able to perform thorough, accurate to life testing on real world roads in a repeatable manner.

Finally, the open-source nature of the system allows users to easily tailor and extend the simulation bench's capabilities as they desire. The simulation bench is in no way constrained by the traditional limitations of autonomous vehicle development and allows for a large user base to easily engage and perform research, testing and development on numerous aspects of autonomous vehicle systems. From the infotainment software, to the networking of vehicle subsystems, to the algorithms that physically drive the vehicle itself, the development of all these aspects of autonomous driving systems are supported by the autonomous vehicle simulation bench.

In addition to the points mentioned, the proposed system also supports the development of emerging technologies such as smart infrastructure communications with autonomous vehicles. However, the possible extents to what development is supported in this system is virtually endless, as continuous support is provided for the technologies that power the simulation bench and there is no barriers to what additions can be made to an open-source platform.

The proposed autonomous vehicle simulation bench bridges a gap that has been left unfilled in the autonomous vehicle development space by providing a base for a solution that is an inexpensive, widely accessible, highly repeatable, extremely robust, largely supported and tremendously extendable platform to support the development of autonomous vehicle systems.
