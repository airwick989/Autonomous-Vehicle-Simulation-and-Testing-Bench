# CARLA Capstone Project

## What is CARLA?
CARLA is an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions.

## What is this Capstone Project?
This Capstone project is attempting to integrate real hardware used in cars to connect with CARLA to create a Hardware-In-The-Loop environment. Additionally, it aims to improve the software to bring a more realistic and more modern features for the user to interact with.
