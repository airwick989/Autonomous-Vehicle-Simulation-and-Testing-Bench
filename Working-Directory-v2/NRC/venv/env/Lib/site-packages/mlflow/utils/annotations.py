    - maintain backwards compatibility such that earlier versions of any MLflow client, cli, or
      server will not have issues with any changes being made to them from an interface perspective.
    - maintain a consistent contract with respect to existing named arguments such that
      modifications will not alter or remove an existing named argument.
    - maintain implied or declared types of arguments within its signature.
    - maintain consistent behavior with respect to return types.

    Note: Should an API marked as `@developer_stable` require a modification for enhanced feature
      functionality, a deprecation warning will be added to the API well in advance of its
      modification.

    Note: Should an API marked as `@developer_stable` require patching for any security reason,
      advanced notice is not guaranteed and the labeling of such API as stable will be ignored
      for the sake of such a security patch.
